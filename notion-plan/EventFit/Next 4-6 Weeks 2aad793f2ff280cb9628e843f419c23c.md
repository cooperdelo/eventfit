# Next 4-6 Weeks

## 🗓️ **4–6 Week Validation + MVP Sprint Plan**

### **🎯 Objective**

Validate _EventFit’s_ concept (college event-based outfit renting and inspiration app) by confirming:

- Students want a more organized, aesthetic way to plan event outfits.
- Sorority/org event integration adds value beyond Snapchat or GroupMe.
- Renting and sharing outfits feels safe and convenient.
- The MVP core features are both _wanted_ and _usable._

## 🗓️ **WEEK 1: Foundational Research & Prep**

### **Goals**

- Define assumptions, target persona, and key interview questions.
- Identify main competitive landscape and differentiators.

### **Tasks**

1. **User Persona Creation**
   - Define 3 key user types:
     - Sorority girls organizing events
     - Regular students looking for outfit inspo/rentals
     - Teachers or club leaders posting events
   - Identify each persona’s goals, frustrations, and current “hacks” (ex: using Snapchat, Instagram).
2. **Competitive Scan**
   - Review 3–5 college fashion rental apps (like Curtsy, StyleMe, Boro).
   - Create a simple Notion table with:
     - Core features
     - Weak points
     - Gaps EventFit can fill (especially with the event-calendar layer)
3. **Interview Prep**
   - Create your script (below)
   - Recruit ~10–15 participants (friends, sorority members, student leaders)
   - Prepare a 3-minute visual demo (mockup or explanation deck)

## 🗓️ **WEEK 2–3: User Interviews & Feature Validation**

### **Goals**

- Conduct in-person interviews
- Validate problem, demand, and feature appeal

### **Tasks**

1. **Conduct 10–15 Student Interviews**
   - Focus on understanding real behavior (not hypotheticals)
   - Take notes on repeated phrases or reactions (“I would use that,” “That’s confusing,” etc.)
2. **Interview Structure**
   - 5 minutes: background + current habits
   - 10 minutes: idea presentation and reactions
   - 5 minutes: “what if” questions (test new concepts)

---

### 💬 **Example Research Questions**

### **A. Understanding the Problem**

- How do you currently decide what to wear for big events (formals, gameday, etc.)?
- Do you usually plan your outfit alone, or do you talk with friends first?
- Have you ever borrowed or rented clothes for an event? What was that experience like?
- What annoys you most about finding outfits for college events?

### **B. Validating the Solution**

- Imagine an app that helps students rent outfits and post what they’re wearing for events. Would you use it?
- What kind of events would you care about most? (formals, gameday, concerts, etc.)
- How often do you think you’d browse other people’s outfits?
- Would you feel comfortable renting from people on your campus?

### **C. Feature Reactions**

- Would you want to create an event and tag your outfit for it?
- Would you prefer renting within your friend groups or from verified strangers?
- How important is seeing “style boards” or outfit inspiration for specific events?
- Do you like the idea of a leaderboard or “Outfit of the Week” voted on by students?
- Would you ever pay to rent through a secure in-app payment system?

### **D. Safety & Trust**

- What would make you trust someone enough to rent or lend clothes?
- Would a secure payment/return system make you more likely to use the app?
- Should people be verified by university email or ID?

## 🗓️ **WEEK 4: Insight Synthesis + MVP Definition**

### **Goals**

- Turn insights into actionable MVP features.
- Create Notion-based MVP blueprint with feature priorities.

### **Tasks**

1. **Summarize Findings**
   - Identify top 3 problems users consistently mentioned.
   - Identify top 3 features people were most excited about.
2. **Define MVP Feature Set**
   - Prioritize features that solve those top 3 problems.
     Example MVP might include:
     - Event calendar (public + organization events)
     - Outfit posting tied to events
     - Peer-to-peer renting with secure escrow
     - Style boards for event inspiration
3. **Draft MVP Product Flow**
   - Map out full user journey:
     - Onboarding → Event discovery → Outfit browsing → Renting → Payment → Return
4. **MVP Notion Doc Setup**
   - Create one Notion page per feature:
     - Overview
     - Purpose
     - Frontend flow
     - Backend logic
     - UI sketch or inspiration

## 🗓️ **WEEK 5–6: Prototype & Pre-MVP Validation**

### **Goals**

- Validate UX concepts and refine messaging
- Prepare final feature specs for Cursor integration

### **Tasks**

1. **Create Basic Figma Mockups**
   - Onboarding
   - Home (Event feed)
   - Event page with outfit listings
   - Outfit detail + Rent flow
   - Profile/Closet view
2. **Run Quick UX Tests**
   - Have 5–7 users click through the mockup
   - Ask: “Would you know what to do next?” or “Would you use this?”
3. **Refine & Finalize MVP Scope**
   - Keep **core 4** features:
     1. Event-based outfit renting & posting
     2. Public/private events system
     3. Style boards for event inspiration
     4. Secure renting/payments flow
4. **Plan Transition to Cursor Dev Phase**
   - Translate Notion doc into Cursor
   - Generate architecture for each page + feature
   - Plan testing and launch strategy

## ✅ **Expected Outcome After 6 Weeks**

- 10–15 real interview transcripts or summaries
- 1 clear MVP scope (features & flow validated)
- Early Figma prototype ready for feedback
- Fully organized Notion MVP file ready for Cursor to code
- List of initial testers for beta

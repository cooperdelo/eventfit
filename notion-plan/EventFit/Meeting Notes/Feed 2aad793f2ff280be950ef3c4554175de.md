## 🔥 **— What You See, Exactly**

When you open the app, your **Home Feed** feels like a mix of Instagram + a marketplace. The layout is:

### **1. Top Navigation Bar**

- **Search bar** (at the very top)
- Icons for:
  🔍 Search • ❤️ Likes • 🔔 Notifications • 💬 Messages
- Your **profile picture** is in the top-right corner.

---

## **2. The Main Feed (Center Section)**

This is a **vertical scroll** feed, mostly white background with clean spacing.

You’ll see:

### **👉 Big Photo Posts (most of the feed)**

Each post shows:

- A **large square image** of the item (like Instagram style)
- Sometimes a **carousel** (you can swipe for more pics)
- Under the photo:
  - **Seller’s username + profile photo**
  - **Price** (bold, usually in black)
  - **Short item description** (often 1–2 words unless you tap)

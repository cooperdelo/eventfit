### **Goals**

- Conduct in-person interviews
- Validate problem, demand, and feature appeal

### **Tasks**

1. **Conduct 10–15 Student Interviews**
   - Focus on understanding real behavior (not hypotheticals)
   - Take notes on repeated phrases or reactions (“I would use that,” “That’s confusing,” etc.)
2. **Interview Structure**
   - 5 minutes: background + current habits
   - 10 minutes: idea presentation and reactions
   - 5 minutes: “what if” questions (test new concepts)

### 💬 **Example Research Questions**

### **A. Understanding the Problem**

- How do you currently decide what to wear for big events (formals, gameday, etc.)?
- Do you usually plan your outfit alone, or do you talk with friends first?
- Have you ever borrowed or rented clothes for an event? What was that experience like?
- What annoys you most about finding outfits for college events?

### **B. Validating the Solution**

- Imagine an app that helps students rent outfits and post what they’re wearing for events. Would you use it?
- What kind of events would you care about most? (formals, gameday, concerts, etc.)
- How often do you think you’d browse other people’s outfits?
- Would you feel comfortable renting from people on your campus?

### **C. Feature Reactions**

- Would you want to create an event and tag your outfit for it?
- Would you prefer renting within your friend groups or from verified strangers?
- How important is seeing “style boards” or outfit inspiration for specific events?
- Do you like the idea of a leaderboard or “Outfit of the Week” voted on by students?
- Would you ever pay to rent through a secure in-app payment system?

### **D. Safety & Trust**

- What would make you trust someone enough to rent or lend clothes?
- Would a secure payment/return system make you more likely to use the app?
- Should people be verified by university email or ID?

- Go through table above.
- Clarify what each person can realistically contribute weekly.

### **3. Equity & Ownership (10 min)**

  - Sister → draft basic budget and ops plan.

---

## 🧭 7. Recommended Next Actions (After Meeting)

1. **File for EventFit LLC** → simplest protection + equity structure.
2. **Use Notion or Slack** for internal updates.
3. **Create shared Google Sheet** for roles, equity, and milestones.
4. **Write short founder agreement** outlining:
   - Each person’s role.
   - Equity vesting (time- or contribution-based).
   - Decision-making structure (you as final call).

---

## ✍️ My Input (Strategic)

- Keep equity **symbolic early** — 5% is fair for unpaid part-time help.
- Use **vesting to protect** yourself from people quitting.
- Focus your dev time only on **must-have features** for MVP (feed + posts + likes/comments).
- Delay rentals until after user traction.
- Don’t waste money early — traction at UNC is your biggest validator.
- Once you hit 300+ users, start **affiliate links + sponsored campaigns**.

### 🧠 You (CEO & Builder)

- Build MVP core (user auth, event browsing, outfit posting system).
- Define feature roadmap (e.g., Phase 1: post + view fits → Phase 2: rent clothes + event sync).
- Coordinate with marketing/sister weekly.

---

### 🎯 Marketing Team (2 girls, ~5% each)

Right now, their mission is to **make EventFit look alive and desirable before launch**.

**Tasks to assign immediately:**

1. **Brand Voice + Visuals:**
   - Define tone (fun, stylish, UNC-student vibe, not “AI startup” tone).
   - Make Canva templates for Instagram + TikTok posts.
   - Research trendy fonts and colors (warm, human, indie feel).
2. **Social Presence:**
   - Create handles (`@eventfit.app`, `@eventfitunc`, etc.).
   - Post teasers — use UNC events or outfit inspo from real people.
   - Create a waitlist Google Form (“Join early access to EventFit!”).
3. **Community Growth:**
   - DM campus fashion influencers and event organizers.
   - Post polls (“What’s your favorite outfit for He’s Not? 🎤👕”) to build traction.
4. **Launch Prep:**
   - Collect 20–30 emails or IG handles for early testers.
   - Mock up example posts so you have pre-launch “content.”

### 💼 Your Sister (Finance + Ops)

She’s not building the product, but she can **set up your structure and manage your foundation**.

**Tasks for her:**

1. **Business setup:**
   - Research **how to form an LLC in North Carolina.**
   - Handle paperwork and ownership split once you’re ready.
   - Track any potential expenses (domain, LLC, logo, etc.) in a Google Sheet.
   - Research student entrepreneurship grants (UNC has some).
2. **Design coordination:**
   - Learn **Figma basics** — she can start designing mockups of pages (sign-up, outfit card, event list).
   - These mockups help you visualize features and show others progress.
   - She doesn’t need to be a designer — Figma has tons of templates she can modify.
3. **Documentation:**
   - Keep a shared Notion or Google Drive for all ideas, designs, and progress.

---

## 💻 2. About Figma → Code (Cursor Integration)

Yes — Cursor **can absolutely read and interpret Figma files** (via plugin or direct inspection).

Here’s how it helps:

1. In Figma, your sister creates each screen.
2. You export the design (or give Cursor the Figma URL).
3. Cursor analyzes the components (colors, layout, buttons, text).
4. Cursor then generates **React or Tailwind code** for those UI components — which you can refine manually.

So yes, **Figma → Cursor → Frontend** is a perfect workflow for your team.

She just needs to label components clearly (“EventCard,” “FitPost,” “ProfilePage,” etc.) so Cursor can map them easily.

---

## 🧾 3. Forming the LLC (How + Cost)

Since you’re based at UNC (North Carolina):

1. **File through NC Secretary of State website** → [https://www.sosnc.gov/divisions/business_registration](https://www.sosnc.gov/divisions/business_registration)
2. Choose **LLC (Limited Liability Company)**.
3. Filing fee: **$125** (one-time).
4. You’ll need:
   - A business name (“EventFit LLC”)
   - Your registered agent (can be you)
   - Mailing address (can use your home or school)
5. You can also grab a **domain** (e.g., `eventfit.app`) for ~$15/year.

**Tip:**

Don’t file _right now_ if money is tight — you can wait until the MVP is ready or until you’re about to launch publicly.

Right now, just operate informally and track ownership in writing (like a simple “Founders Agreement” doc).

# Figma

Here’s **exactly how to use Figma to turn this EventFit spec into a real app prototype** — broken into simple, beginner-friendly steps.

# ⭐️ **How to Use Figma to Create Your EventFit App (Step-by-Step Guide)**

_(This is the exact workflow product designers use.)_

---

# **1. Set Up Your Figma Workspace**

### **1. Create a New File**

- Go to Figma → **New Design File**
- Rename it: **EventFit – App V1**

### **2. Set Up Frames for Mobile**

- Press **A** (Frame tool)
- Choose **iPhone 13/14** size (390×844)
  This becomes your screen size template.

### **3. Create a Page Structure**

Rename pages in the left sidebar:

1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
2. **Mid-Fidelity UI**
3. **High-Fidelity (Final UI)**
4. **Design System**
5. **Prototype Flows**

This keeps everything organized like a real product team.

---

# **2. Start With Low-Fidelity Wireframes (Boxes Only)**

This is where you turn your idea into screens before adding color or visuals.

You can rough-draw each screen using only:

- Boxes → for layout
- Text → for labels
- Circles → for profile photos
- Grey shapes → for placeholders

### **Screens you need (based on your MVP):**

### **🔹 Onboarding / Sign-In**

- Logo
- “Sign in with School Email”
- `.edu` email verification screen

### **🔹 Home / Campus Feed**

Tabs at the bottom:

- Events
- Inspiration
- Rent (Post)
- Messages
- Profile

### **🔹 Event Page**

Event info:

- Title
- Date
- Theme
- Dress code (optional)
- Cover photo
- “Join Event”
- Tabs:
  - **Outfit Feed**
  - **Get Inspired**
  - **Rent Items**

### **🔹 Event Outfit Feed**

Grid of real outfits:

- Outfit photo
- Title
- Available to rent?
- Price
- Likes

### **🔹 Get Inspired (Curated Looks)**

- Section: “Curated for Formal”
- Mood board card layout
- Outfit images + “shop” or “rent similar”

### **🔹 Rent/Closet Listing**

For users posting:

- Upload image
- Item name
- Brand
- Size
- Rental price
- Pickup/meetup options

### **🔹 Profile**

- Profile photo
- Bio
- Organization tags
- Closet tab (carousel of items)
- Reviews

You should create **one wireframe per screen**, with arrows showing the flow.

---

# **3. Move to Mid-Fidelity (Add Basic UI Style)**

Once the layout is solid:

### **Add visual structure:**

- Switch boxes to **rounded cards**
- Add **bottom navigation bar**
- Add **real spacing (8pt, 16pt, 24pt)**
- Add **simple icons** (Figma has an Icon plugin)

### **Recommended Figma Plugins:**

- **Material Symbols** (icons)
- **Iconify** (icons)
- **Wireframe** (faster building blocks)
- **Lorem Ipsum** (placeholder text)

---

# **4. Build Your Basic Design System**

Create a page called **Design System** and define:

### **Colors**

A simple palette for EventFit:

- Primary Blue (UNC-style)
- Secondary Pink or Lilac
- Neutrals (black/gray/white)
- Accent (green for success / red for errors)

### **Typography**

Use **Inter** or **SF Pro** for a clean app look.

Define:

- H1 / H2 / H3
- Body
- Caption

### **Components (Re-usable Blocks)**

Turn these into components:

- Buttons
- Navigation bar
- Event card
- Outfit card
- Profile header
- Item card
- Tag/Pill (for organization labels)

This makes the app consistent.

---

# **5. High-Fidelity Designs (Full Color + UI Polish)**

Now replace your wireframes with:

- Real images
- Real outfit posts
- Final colors
- Real icons
- Shadows
- Rounded corners
- Polished spacing

These should look like screenshots of a real app.

---

# **6. Add Interactive Prototypes (Clickable App)**

Go to **Prototype** mode in Figma.

### **Link screens together:**

- Tap event → opens event page
- Tap outfit → opens outfit detail
- Tap “Rent Now” → opens payment flow
- Swipe tabs → go to corresponding pages
- Tap “Post Your Outfit” → upload listing screen

Use “Smart Animate” for smooth transitions.

This lets you demo the app to investors, teammates, or users.

# **7. Create Your MVP Flow (Based on Your Spec)**

### **Flow 1: Discover Event Outfit Inspiration**

1. Home → Event page
2. “Get Inspired”
3. Click a curated look
4. See details → rental or buy links

### **Flow 2: Peer-to-Peer Rental**

1. Event page → Outfit post
2. Tap item
3. “Rent for $xx”
4. Payment modal (Stripe)
5. Confirmation screen

### **Flow 3: Posting an Outfit**

1. Tab bar → “+”
2. Upload photos
3. Add details
4. Tag event
5. Confirm post

### **Flow 4: Profile and Closet**

1. Profile → Closet tab
2. Item previews
3. Reviews

---

# **8. Preview on Your Phone**

Download the **Figma mobile app**.

- Tap **Mirror**
- Scan your prototype
- Now your app literally works on your phone like a real app.

This is how startups pitch.

---

# **9. (Optional) Build for Developers**

If you're handing off to a developer:

### Provide:

- Design system
- Component library
- Annotated flows
- Exportable assets
- Redlines (spacing, font sizes)

Figma has a **developer handoff panel** that automatically generates the CSS/React Native values.

If you want, I can create:

- All MVP screens
- Event page layouts

Just tell me:

👉 “Make me the Figma layouts for the MVP screens”

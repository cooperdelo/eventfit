# Admin

## **Admin Dashboard Overview**

**Key Principles:**

- Role-based access: super-admin, content moderator, finance/transaction manager
- Mobile-friendly, but primarily desktop-first (most admin work is on larger screens)

- Connect rental logic, event approvals, and user moderation to the same backend for consistency.

### **Cursor Instructions**

> Generate each admin page as a separate React module with Tailwind styling.
>
> Ensure:
>
> - Strict architecture standards (folder structure, separation of concerns, reusable components)
> - Integration hooks for backend APIs (Node.js / Firebase / API placeholders)
> - Role-based access logic
> - Mobile-first responsive design, visually clean and college-friendly (avoid AI/gradient aesthetics)

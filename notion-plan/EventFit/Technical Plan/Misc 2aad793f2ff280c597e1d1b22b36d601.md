## **1. Analytics Hooks**

**Goal:** Track key user interactions to measure engagement, adoption, and feature performance. Useful for future gamification, AI recommendations, and growth decisions.

**Frontend Events to Track:**

| Event                    | Trigger                          | Properties to Capture                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| User Signup / Login      | When user completes auth         | `userId`, `email`, `school`, `orgAffiliation`, timestamp |
| Outfit Posted            | User submits outfit              | `userId`, `eventId`, `outfitId`, `rentable`, `tags`      |
| Outfit Liked / Commented | User interacts with outfit       | `userId`, `outfitId`, `reactionType`, timestamp          |
| Rental Request           | User requests to rent an outfit  | `userId`, `outfitId`, `ownerId`, `eventId`               |
| Rental Approval / Return | Lender approves, renter confirms | `userId`, `outfitId`, `status`, timestamp                |
| Event Created            | Org or user creates event        | `eventId`, `creatorId`, `public/private`, timestamp      |
| Chat Message Sent        | User sends a message             | `chatId`, `senderId`, `recipientIds`, `eventId/orgId`    |
| Notification Triggered   | Push or in-app                   | `userId`, `type`, `relatedId`, timestamp                 |
| Search / Filter Used     | User searches outfits/events     | `userId`, `query`, `filters`, timestamp                  |

**Backend / Database Layer:**

- Capture all events in a separate analytics table or service.
- Consider using **PostgreSQL + analytics table** or external service like **Mixpanel / Amplitude**.
- Store timestamps, user IDs, and event metadata.

**Future Use Cases:**

- Outfit of the Week / Leaderboards
- AI recommendation models
- Feature engagement analysis
- Marketing / growth funnels

## **2. Testing / QA Notes**

**Frontend Testing:**

- **Unit Tests:** Each component (Cards, Buttons, Modals)
  - Suggested tool: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests:** Event feed, Outfit posting, Rental flow
- **UI Component Library Testing:** Storybook
  - Each card / hero / CTA component isolated
- **Responsive Testing:** Desktop + Tablet + Mobile breakpoints
- **Accessibility:** Use Lighthouse / axe for color contrast, alt text, tab navigation

**Backend Testing:**

- **API Endpoints:** REST endpoints for Events, Outfits, Rentals, Chats
  - Test CRUD operations
  - Validate authentication & authorization
- **Payment / Escrow Flow:** Stripe sandbox testing
- **Database Integrity:** Referential integrity for Users → Outfits → Rentals → Events

**End-to-End Testing:**

- Use Cypress or Playwright for:
  - Signing up and posting outfits
  - Requesting / approving rentals
  - Joining events, sending chat messages
  - Receiving notifications

**QA / Dev Workflow:**

- Use **feature branches** + pull requests
- Automated CI/CD for testing
- Bug tracking in Notion / Jira

## **3. Error States / Empty States**

**Key Pages / Features and Suggested States:**

| Page / Feature         | Empty State                                                                    | Error State                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event Feed / Dashboard | “No outfits posted yet. Be the first to post for your event!” CTA: Post Outfit | “Couldn’t load feed. Retry” button                               |
| Outfit Posting         | N/A (always user-initiated)                                                    | “Upload failed. Check image size / connection.”                  |
| Profile / Closet       | “Your closet is empty. Add outfits to start renting!”                          | “Couldn’t load your closet. Retry”                               |
| Event Detail / Feed    | “No outfits have been shared for this event yet.” CTA: Add outfit              | “Failed to load event feed. Retry”                               |
| Search / Filter        | “No results found for your search.” CTA: Reset filters                         | “Search failed. Check your connection.”                          |
| Renting System         | N/A                                                                            | “Rental request failed. Check payment info / item availability.” |
| Notifications          | “No notifications yet.”                                                        | “Failed to load notifications. Retry”                            |
| Chat / Messaging       | “No messages yet. Start the conversation!”                                     | “Failed to send message. Retry”                                  |
| Admin Panel            | N/A                                                                            | “Couldn’t load admin data. Check permissions / connection.”      |

**UI Guidelines for Error / Empty States:**

- Use **illustrations or subtle icons** (Lucide) to visually convey empty/error state.
- Keep **consistent typography & padding** with main design.
- Provide **clear CTA** or retry button.
- Avoid generic “Oops” messages — make them friendly and campus-style (“No outfits yet — start your style streak!”).

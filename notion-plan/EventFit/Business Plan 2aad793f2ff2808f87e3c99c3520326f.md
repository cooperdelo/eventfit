# Business Plan

## **1. Executive Summary**

**EventFit** is a campus-based social rental and event-styling app built for college students — especially women in sororities and student organizations — to **rent, lend, and get outfit inspiration** for upcoming events.

Unlike generic clothing rental apps, EventFit integrates **campus events, private group feeds, and trusted peer-to-peer renting** — while also offering a built-in **event-based outfit inspiration system** that helps students plan their looks with real examples and direct shopping links.

Users can explore what people at their school are wearing for formals, gamedays, or concerts, rent items directly, and discover new events to attend — all in one trusted platform.

Our mission:

> To make dressing for college events easier, more sustainable, and more social — while building the most trusted event-style community on campus.

## **2. Problem & Market Validation**

### **The Problem**

College students — especially sorority women — constantly face:

- **Pressure to find new outfits** for recurring events (formals, gamedays, themed parties).
- **Wasteful spending** and closet clutter for one-time outfits.
- **Unreliable borrowing** through Snapchat or text DMs (no structure, no protection, high flakiness).
- **No centralized place** to see what people are actually wearing for campus events.

### **Current Behavior**

- Borrowing/renting through DMs or texts.
- Buying fast fashion for one-time events.
- Searching Pinterest or TikTok for outfit inspiration, with no local relevance.
- Using Google Sheets or GroupMe to coordinate looks.

### **Opportunity**

Students already lend, borrow, and coordinate — EventFit **formalizes and enhances** these habits through:

- Secure in-app payments and return tracking.
- Centralized event feeds combining inspiration + rentals.
- Campus-only exclusivity to build trust and social relevance.

## **3. Product Overview**

EventFit combines four core experiences:

1. **Event-Based Outfit Discovery**
2. **Peer-to-Peer Renting**
3. **Smart Event-Based Inspiration**
4. **Campus Social Calendar**

---

### **3.1 Core Features (MVP)**

### **1. Event Creation + Group Ownership**

- Organizations (e.g., sororities, clubs, teams) can create **private or public event pages**.
- Each event includes:
  - Title, date, theme, and optional dress code.
  - Cover photo and event description.
  - Event visibility: _Public (campus-wide)_ or _Private (invite-only)_.
  - Optional “Approved by Admin” moderation for legitimacy.

### **2. Event Feed + Lookbook Board**

- A visual feed of **outfits tagged to that specific event**.
- Each post shows:
  - Outfit photo, brand/size, and price.
  - Availability (for rent, or “inspiration only”).
  - Likes/reactions and comments.
- Filters:
  - “Friends Only”
  - “Available to Rent”
  - “Top Liked”
  - “Buyable Looks” (direct shopping links)

### **3. Smart Event-Based Inspiration System**

- Each event includes a **“Get Inspired” section** showing curated looks and accessories for that event type.
- Inspiration is:
  - Curated manually during MVP phase.
  - Organized by theme (e.g., “UNC Gameday,” “Formal,” “Oktoberfest”).
  - Includes optional **external links to buy items** from student-friendly brands (Princess Polly, Amazon, Revolve, etc.).
- Later versions will evolve into an **AI Style Assistant** that auto-curates suggestions by theme, color, and weather.

This turns EventFit into **a one-stop pre-event planning tool** — where users can _see ideas, rent items, or buy new ones._

## **4. Differentiation Strategy**

| Competitor               | Weakness                                                               | EventFit Advantage                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Other college rental app | Focuses solely on rentals; lacks event connection and social features. | EventFit links rentals to **real events + inspiration**.     |
| Snapchat/Instagram       | Unstructured borrowing, no payment protection.                         | EventFit provides secure renting and centralized discovery.  |
| Pinterest/TikTok         | Generic inspiration, no local context.                                 | EventFit gives **real outfits from your own campus events**. |
| Poshmark/Depop           | Broad resale focus, no social layer.                                   | EventFit is college-exclusive and event-driven.              |

**Bottom line:**

EventFit isn’t just a rental app — it’s the **social hub for event fashion and inspiration.**

## **7. Go-To-Market Strategy**

**Target:** College women (18–22), especially in sororities and event-heavy organizations.

### **Acquisition Tactics**

1. **Ambassador Program** → 3–5 reps per sorority to post and promote EventFit.
2. **Event Sponsorships** → QR codes at formals, gamedays, and concerts.
3. **TikTok/Instagram Reels** → “What UNC Wore to Gameday” trend videos.
4. **Campus Exclusivity Hype** → Invitation-only at launch to drive FOMO.

---

## **8. 4–6 Week Sprint Plan (Validation + MVP)**

### **Weeks 1–2: Research & Interviews**

Target: 10–15 students (sororities + general).

Focus questions:

- How do you currently find outfit ideas for events?
- Would you rent from peers on campus if payments were secure?
- What frustrates you about borrowing/lending through DMs?
- How often do you need new outfits for events?

- Would you trust renting if EventFit handled payment protection?

Deliverable: Validation report + MVP refinements.
